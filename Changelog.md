**UrukDroid 1.5** (15.08.2011) [Manamana!](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8N_tupPBtWQ)
  * `[`CHANGE`]` Since UrukDroid 1.1 (both beta1/2/3 and release candidate 1/2/3) had stability and compatibility issues - that I was unable to trace down (too many changes on changes etc.) - I've decided to implement all stuff from beginning on fresh OS. Since all "reverse engineering" stuff was already made and I already have required knowledge - It should be the fastest method. So entire system is cleaned up, updated to latest binaries - and so far looks good :). That's why I've bumped version to 1.5 - just to make it a bit more visible it's not a straight continuation of 1.0/1.1.
  * `[`FIX`]` No more "soft reboots" (system reloaded it's graphics UI part)
