*UrukDroid 1.5* (15.08.2011) [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8N_tupPBtWQ Manamana!]
 * `[`CHANGE`]` Since UrukDroid 1.1 (both beta1/2/3 and release candidate 1/2/3) had stability and compatibility issues - that I was unable to trace down (too many changes on changes etc.) - I've decided to implement all stuff from beginning on fresh OS. Since all "reverse engineering" stuff was already made and I already have required knowledge - It should be the fastest method. So entire system is cleaned up, updated to latest binaries - and so far looks good :). That's why I've bumped version to 1.5 - just to make it a bit more visible it's not a straight continuation of 1.0/1.1.
 * `[`FIX`]` No more "soft reboots" (system reloaded it's graphics UI part)
 * `[`FIX`]` No more turning off WiFi issue (but it happens that WiFi can't pop in after full reboot - another reboot is required)
