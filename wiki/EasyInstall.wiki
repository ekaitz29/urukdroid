<wiki:toc max_depth="2" />

= Introduction =

EasyInstall is a code name for simple installation framework for UrukDroid. It was created as a successor of previous installation method, involving Linux usage which was to harsh for most of our users.

= Usage =

EasyInstall consist of two files, initramfs and kernel image. Both need to be applied to Archos device with help of "Boot Menu" (see [http://code.google.com/p/urukdroid/wiki/Installation#Step_one installation process]}.

After boot up (use _"Boot Menu"_ and choose _"Developer edition"_) you should see screen with title "UrukDroid? 1.0 Installation framework" and simple menu tree:

 * Are you sure you want to proced with installation of UrukDroid?
  # No
  # [#Install_UrukDroid Install UrukDroid]
  # [#ReInstall_UrukDroid ReInstall UrukDroid]

== Install UrukDroid ==

== ReInstall UrukDroid ==
EI will help you to repair damaged UrukDroid installation by reformatting rootfs without touching datafs (stored apps and settings).

 # Do you want to ReInstall/Repair UrukDroid on removable SD card, or internal storage?
  * ReInstall to SDCard"
  * ReInstall to Internal storage

In both cases EI will try to format proper partition, will ask you to transfer installation file and will prepare device for later installation.

EI can't really check if what you have chosen is correct answer (about installation type) - so if you choose badly it may format wrong partition - so please be careful.
