#summary Booting up alternative OSes functionality

= Introduction =

Since 1.1 (some hardly working features were introduced in 1.0) there is [RescueMenu Rescue Menu] with Alternative OS boot functionality. Now you can store and boot more operating systems on your table.


= Details =

If you want to boot other then UrukDroid (Android) operating system, like plain Linux (Debian, Armstrong) or try MeeGo - you can now do it with UrukDroid rescue menu. Limitation is to the same kernel (modules are separate).

To do so you need to create proper boot file in /AlternativeOS directory called "name.boot". Rescue menu will automatically search for this type of files and ask user to choose one of them.

= Boot files structure =

Every boot file is a simple shell script with header. In header there should be name and description (for future use).
Body of the script is usually a mount option (to mount proper root file system) and chroot operation with launching init process.
