# Introduction #

This menu has some tools to fix your partially broken tablet. With new release you should find here more, and more options. This menu was introduced in UrukDroid 1.6.

# Erase Dalvik cache #

This will erase Dalvik cache directory (/data/dalvik-cache/). You may want to use this option when your device became unstable, unbootable etc. after some applications update or modification. This is completely safe to run this function (even when device is not broken). As a result during next run, your system will need to rebuild this cache - thus it will take much longer it to start (much, much longer - so be patient, and this time depends on how many application is installed).

# Disable overclocking #

If you enabled overclocking, and your device became unbootable - you may disable overclocking with this option. Next time [read overclocking manual](UrukService_cpugovernor.md) more carefully ;)
